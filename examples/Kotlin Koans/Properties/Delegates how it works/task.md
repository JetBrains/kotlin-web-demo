## Delegates

You may declare your own [delegates](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/delegated-properties.html#property-delegate-requirements).
Implement the methods of the class 'EffectiveDate' so it can be delegated to.
Store only the time in milliseconds in 'timeInMillis' property.

Use the extension functions `MyDate.toMillis()` and `Long.toDate()`, defined at
[MyDate.kt](/#/Kotlin%20Koans/Properties/Delegates%20how%20it%20works/MyDate.kt)
