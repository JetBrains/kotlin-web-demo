## Generic functions

Make the following code compile by implementing a `partitionTo` function that splits
a collection into two collections according to a predicate.

There is a [`partition()`](http://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/partition.html)
function in the standard library that always returns two newly created lists.
You should write a function that splits the collection into two collections given as arguments.
The signature of the
[`toCollection()`](http://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/to-collection.html)
 function from the standard library may help you.
