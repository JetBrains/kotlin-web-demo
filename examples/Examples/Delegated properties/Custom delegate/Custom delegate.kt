/**
 * There's some new syntax: you can say `val 'property name': 'Type' by 'expression'`.
 * The expression after by is the delegate, because get() and set() methods
 * corresponding to the property will be delegated to it.
 * Property delegates don't have to implement any interface, but they have
 * to provide methods named get() and set() to be called.</p>
