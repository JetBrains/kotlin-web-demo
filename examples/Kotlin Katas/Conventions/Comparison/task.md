## Comparison

Read about [operator overloading](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/operator-overloading.html)
to learn how different conventions for operations like `==`, `<`, `+` work in Kotlin.
Add the function `compareTo` to the class MyDate to make it comparable.
After that the code below `date1 < date2` will start to compile.
