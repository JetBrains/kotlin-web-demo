## Simple Functions

Take a look at [function syntax](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html#defining-functions)
and make the function `start` return the string `"OK"`.
Then press 'Run' to ensure that the test passes.

In the tasks the function `TODO()` is used that throws an exception.
Your job during the katas will be to replace this function invocation with a meaningful code according to the problem.
