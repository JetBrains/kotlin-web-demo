## Html builder

_1._ Fill the table with proper values from the product list.
The products are declared in [data.kt](/#/Workshop/Builders/Html%20builders/data.kt).

_2._ Color the table in a chess order (using getTitleColor() and getCellColor() functions above).
Pass a color as an argument to the functions `tr`, `td`.

You can run 'JavaScript(Canvas)' configuration to see the rendered table.
