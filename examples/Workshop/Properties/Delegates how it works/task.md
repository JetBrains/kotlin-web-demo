## Delegates

Implement methods of the EffectiveDate class so it could be used as a delegate for properties
with type MyDate and delegated value would be stored as Long.

Use extension functions `MyDate.toMillis()` and `Long.toDate()`, defined at
[MyDate.kt](/#/Workshop/Properties/Delegates%20how%20it%20works/MyDate.kt)
