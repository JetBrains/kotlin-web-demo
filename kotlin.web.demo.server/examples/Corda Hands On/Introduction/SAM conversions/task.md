## SAM conversions

When an object implements a SAM interface (one with a Single Abstract Method),
you can pass a lambda instead.
Read more about [SAM-conversions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html#sam-conversions).

In the previous example change an object expression to a lambda.
